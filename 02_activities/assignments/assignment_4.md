# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontario’s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
Python 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    Python: 

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    Business Analysts and housing policy makers to understand the projected supply 
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    To understand each Municipality's 2024 target, progression to date and progress % in housing supply between January – April 2024  
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
    Substantive: observing current progression trend for 2024 housing target against total built which is 2024 Progression % 
    Perceptual: differentiating line colours for 2024 housing target and total build progress 
    Aesthetic: using line graph to depict the data and progression by Municipality 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    Documenting and adding comments to Python codes to be able to reproduce stacked bar charts to represent dataset
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    Using contrasting colours for different segments and adding data label for % progression to read/undestand the visualization 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    City planners, policy makers, analysts and housing developers for each Municipality 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    10- year housing target was excluded as from this dataset, it is unclear when the 10-year target starts and ends
    Total housing progress since 2022 was excluded from this dataset as to focus on the data visualization 
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    Reviewing the datasets from Ontario's Open Data Catalogue to understand raw data before choosing the dataset. Excluding two datasets to hone in on visualization 
    Updating column name for 2024 housing progress to date for simplification

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio – put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
